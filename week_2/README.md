# Week 2

## Goal of this week

- Learn essential data structures: List, Set, Tuples and Dictionary
- Learn Python Functions
  - Call functions
  - Write functions
- Finish a quick project employing above knowledge

## Project Description

We like eating in good and exotic restaurants. 
Since most of us don't have cars, we want to eat in closer restaurants. We also care about restaurant's cleanliness and other customer service aspects.

Fortunately for us, the City of Austin maintains a [restaurant dataset][Learn X in Y Minutes - Python] where they keep the restaurants address, zip code and overall inspection score.
And we can directly (and freely!) download the datbase in CSV format.

So our task is to print 10 restaurant (along with it's address, Zip Code and Score), closest to our ZipCode which has a score greater than 90 (prioritize proximity then score).

## Tools of the trade

- Visual Studio Code
- Python (conda is optional)
- Visidata packge (optional)
  - We can sort and visualize easily with this pkg
